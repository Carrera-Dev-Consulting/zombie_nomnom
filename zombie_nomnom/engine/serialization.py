"""This module contains the code that relates to how we can turn our game instances into a dictionary as well as
how we can store commands and load them back dynamically 
i.e. if you make custom commands how to load those commands back.

```python
from zombie_nomnom import ZombieDieGame
from zombie_nomnom.engine.serialization import format_to_json_dict

game = ZombieDieGame(players=["Player Uno"])

game_dict = format_to_json_dict(game)

# now you can write it as a yaml or json using whatever you like.
import json
with open('save_file.dat', 'w') as fp:
    json.dump(game_dict, fp) # write it out to the file!!

# at a later date...
from zombie_nomnom.engine.serialization import parse_game_json_dict
with open('save_file.dat', 'r') as fp:
    game_dict = json.load(fp)

# now we can keep playing like nothing happened!!
game = parse_game_json_dict(game_dict)
```

This allows you to control how you want to seralize the data and we store the format
in the TypedDict definitions within the module if you need to have some more information on how it looks.
This means that whatever way you wanna store these models you can and we can load it as long as the dict 
matches our defined structure.
